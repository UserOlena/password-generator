- Developed a tool that allows employees to create strong, random passwords for increased security;
- Clicking the `generate` button prompts the user to specify the criteria they want in their password through a series of prompts, such as:
    - The password length can fall within the range of `8 to 128 characters`;
    - The user can indicate if they want to include `lowercase` letters;
    - The user can indicate if they want to include `uppercase` letters;
    - The user can indicate if they want to include `numerical values`;
    - The user can indicate if they want to include `special characters`;
- Once the user has responded to each prompt, all criteria are checked for validation to ensure that at least one type of character is selected; 
- When the validation of criteria is successful, the system generates the password;
- The password is shown to the text area for user to copy;
- A `copy` button was added to enhance the user experience, enabling users to copy the text area value to the clipboard;
